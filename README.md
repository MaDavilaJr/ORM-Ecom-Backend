## Installation
npm i

## Usage
I believe you might have to MySQL terminal via "mysql -u root -p" then run "source db/schema.sql" and "SHOW DATABASES" to confirm that the database was created as "ecommerce_db". Then once the database has been created simply run "npm run seed" to populate the database. 

Navigate to the insomnia app and input "http://localhost:3001/api/products/" for example, or any other routes written in the routes directory. Depending on the need you will be able to search a category by its ID, a product by its product_id and a tag by its ID. Simply change the route method to Get, Put, Post, or Delete to change DataBase.
